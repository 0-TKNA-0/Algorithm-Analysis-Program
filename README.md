This library showcases a series of programs that use different sorting algorithms implemented using python.
The Algorithm Analysis Program.py allows a user to enter a custom size for a random array which then is sorted by a chosen algorithm
The Algorithm Analysis Program.py also allows the user to test multiple different sorting algorithms all at the same time using the same randomly generated array and showcases statistics on each, 
such as the number of comparisons that an individual algorithm had done to sort the array, and how long in milliseconds it took for a specific algorithm to complete its comparisons.
